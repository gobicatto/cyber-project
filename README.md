• Automation on Cyber Operations
   
Developed a Bash script to automate connections to a Digital Ocean remote server anonymously, perform target scans using Whois and Nmap, and transfer the gathered data back to the local system. The script also checks for and installs any necessary packages on the local machine.

• Auto System Information and Hash Checking

Designed a Python script to display system information on a Linux machine. Additionally, created a separate Python script to generate and verify file hashes against an offline malicious hash database provided by MalwareBazaar.

• Automated Network and Vulnerabilities Scanning – PenTest Project

Implemented a Python automation script to perform network scans using a specified network IP address. The script incorporates Nmap and Masscan to identify open TCP/UDP ports, Hydra to test for weak passwords on services such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, and RDP, and Searchsploit to detect potential vulnerabilities. 

• Shadow Sentry – SOC Project

Configured a remote server with Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, and Cowrie honeypot. Created an automated Bash script to execute Nmap scans, Hydra, and Metasploit brute force attacks, emulating threat actor behaviors. Set up log collection in a dedicated Cowrie index, implemented alerts for brute force attempts, and created a Kibana dashboard for data visualization.
